# This Expect script was generated by autoexpect on Mon Nov 24 21:47:38 2025
# Expect and autoexpect were both written by Don Libes, NIST.
#
# Note that autoexpect does not guarantee a working script.  It
# necessarily has to guess about certain things.  Two reasons a script
# might fail are:
#
# 1) timing - A surprising number of programs (rn, ksh, zsh, telnet,
# etc.) and devices discard or ignore keystrokes that arrive "too
# quickly" after prompts.  If you find your new script hanging up at
# one spot, try adding a short sleep just before the previous send.
# Setting "force_conservative" to 1 (see below) makes Expect do this
# automatically - pausing briefly before sending each character.  This
# pacifies every program I know of.  The -c flag makes the script do
# this in the first place.  The -C flag allows you to define a
# character to toggle this mode off and on.

set force_conservative 1  ;# set to 1 to force conservative mode even if
			  ;# script wasn't run conservatively originally
if {$force_conservative} {
	set send_slow {1 .1}
	proc send {ignore arg} {
		sleep .1
		exp_send -s -- $arg
	}
}

#
# 2) differing output - Some programs produce different output each time
# they run.  The "date" command is an obvious example.  Another is
# ftp, if it produces throughput statistics at the end of a file
# transfer.  If this causes a problem, delete these patterns or replace
# them with wildcards.  An alternative is to use the -p flag (for
# "prompt") which makes Expect only look for the last line of output
# (i.e., the prompt).  The -P flag allows you to define a character to
# toggle this mode off and on.
#

follows:\r
\r
1. LICENSE GRANT: Pursuant to this Data Analytics Software License Agreement\r
(the \"License Agreement\"),\r
Altair grants Licensee the following non-exclusive, non-assignable,\r
non-transferable, limited license rights to the\r
software specified on the Altair Order Agreement or Quote (the \"Quote\"), in\r
machine-readable object code form\r
only, any installation routines including license key codes, and the\r
technical specifications, user documentation and\r
training materials associated therewith (the \"Documentation\") (collectively,\r
the \"Software\"), subject to Licensee's\r
payment of the license fees as set forth in the Quote and to the terms and\r
conditions set forth herein.\r
\r
(a) Single Named User License. The Software is licensed to a single named\r
user (\"Single Named User\") to be used\r
by that individual only on a single physical or virtual computer (the\r
\"Computer\"). The Single Named User License\r
may be installed on a personal computer or workstation provided that the use\r
of the Software is restricted to the\r
Single Named User. The license for a named individual user can be installed\r
\[Enter\]\r
"
send -- "\r"
expect -exact "\r
on a network server if the\r
corresponding network server license has been purchased. A separate license\r
fee must be paid for each additional\r
Computer on which the Software is used, and the Software may not be used on\r
more Computers than the number of\r
licenses listed on the Quote. Licensee may physically transfer the Software\r
from one Computer to another in the\r
licensed individual's possession and control, provided that Licensee removes\r
all copies of the Software from the\r
Computer from which the Software is being transferred.\r
\r
(b) Network License. If ordered as a Network License, the Network License\r
can be installed on a network server for\r
use only to allow client access to the Software on internal Computers. Each\r
Computer that accesses the Software on\r
the network server must have a separate software license (other than the\r
user manager software). A license for the\r
Software may not be shared or used concurrently on different servers. The\r
number of CPUs contained in the server\r
must be equal to or be less than the number of CPUs the software is licensed\r
for on that server.\r
\r
(c) Subscription License. If ordered as a subscription license pursuant to\r

Use one copy of the Software or the number of copies of the Software\r
specified in the Quote, provided, however,\r
that Licensee's right to use the Software is time-limited to the term\r
specified in the Quote. If Licensee does not\r
purchase a term extension prior to the expiration of the then-current term,\r
then at the end of such term this License\r
Agreement (including any licenses granted hereunder) and the Quote shall be\r
terminated pursuant to Section 7\r
below and Licensee must abide by all provisions stated therein.\r
\r
(d) Units-enabled Subscription License. If ordered as a Units-enabled\r
subscription license pursuant to a Quote,\r
Licensee licenses a pool of Altair Units which allows Licensee to Use\r
Units-enabled Software under Altair's LMS\r
(defined below). When Units-enabled Software is invoked under Altair's LMS,\r
the Units-enabled Software draws\r
down a predetermined number of Altair Units from the pool of Altair Units\r
licensed (as identified on the Quote).\r
Licensee's right to use the Software is not perpetual and is time-limited to\r

Agreement, \"Altair's LMS\" shall be defined as the license management system\r
that accompanies the Software and\r
limits its use in accordance with this License Agreement, and which includes\r
a license log file which gathers and\r
reports anonymized usage information of the Software which shall be made\r
available to Altair automatically on no\r

Agreement and the Quote are expressly\r
conditioned upon Licensee's compliance at all times with the license\r
restrictions set forth in this Section 1(f).\r
Failure to comply with such restrictions shall be grounds for Altair to\r

License Agreement and the Quote. In\r
the event that any audit reveals an underpayment by Licensee of more than\r
five percent (5%) of the amounts due\r
Altair in the period being audited, or that Licensee has breached any term\r
of this License Agreement or Quote, then,\r
in addition to any other remedies Altair may have, Licensee will promptly\r
pay to Altair any underpayments and the\r
cost of the audit and correct any non-compliance.\r

destroying the Software, together with all copies in any form, and providing\r
Altair with written notice of termination\r
and certifying such destruction. In the event of any such termination,\r
Licensee agrees that any pre-paid fees are non-\r

have become due during such term, and such payment shall be due in full upon\r
termination.\r

invalidity, illegality or unenforceability in any\r
jurisdiction shall not invalidate or render illegal or unenforceable such\r
provision in any other jurisdiction.\r

Licensee's responsibility, in the implementation of the Software or in\r

Services and Licensee, at Licensee's own\r
volition for whatever reason, postpone or cancel such Appointment within\r
five working days of the Appointment\r

Appointment between six and ten working days prior to such an Appointment,\r
Altair may, at its discretion, invoke a\r
penalty charge of 50% of the billing charge for such services which would\r
have commenced at the time of the\r
Appointment. Consultancy and training days ordered must be scheduled to be\r
performed within three months of the\r
date of order or they will be invoiced and must be paid for as if they have\r
been performed by Altair; such days\r
invoiced and paid for will remain available to be used for a further three\r
months, after which they will lapse. For\r
each training day provided by Altair, Altair will provide up to six sets of\r
Documentation for Licensee's internal\r
training purposes at no additional charge. Licensee may not make copies of\r
the Documentation. Additional sets of\r
Documentation may be provided to Licensee at a reasonable additional cost.\r
